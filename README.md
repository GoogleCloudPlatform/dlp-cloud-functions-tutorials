# Serverless Data Loss Prevention examples

This repository contains a set of 'serverless' examples to illustrate how to use the Data Loss Prevention API without managing any servers.

## How to use the examples

Use the tutorial to understand how to configure your Google Cloud Platform project to use Cloud functions and the Data Loss Prevention API.

## Quickstart

Clone this repository

` git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dlp-cloud-functions-tutorials.git`

Change directory to one of the example directories

Follow the walkthrough in the tutorial associated with the python example for configuration details of Cloud platform products (Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud IAM permissions) and adapt accordingly using the accompanying README for each example.

Note: you may wish to reuse the same project  to try all examples if so :
* Ensure you delete all files from the buckets you configured for the first tutorial in the series before re-using.
* Delete any exsting cloud functions you have deployed
